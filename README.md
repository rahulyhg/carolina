# Carolina 

This is a Node.js web development framework that I am working on as a personal
project.

It has a few features:

* Wrapper around [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) routing
* A global (bad stuff!) object managing various Services and classes
* Multiple options for managing Session data
* Database connectors for MongoDB or DynamoDB (or local files)
* A system for events and listeners.

## Installation

```
npm i carolina
```

The best way to start is to clone the
[starter project](https://github.com/jfmario/carolina-starter).

## Documentation

The documentation for the project is
[here](http://carolina-site.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/) and it 
contains a tutorial project.
